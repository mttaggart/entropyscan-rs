# entropyscan-rs

Entropy scanner for threat hunting. Also, a teaching project.

The project is broken into separate "Stages" of development.

## Stage 0: MVP

This is the minimum viable product, in which we implement our entropy calculation algorithm, and point it to a file to calculate. Very bare-bones, but this is where we start.
